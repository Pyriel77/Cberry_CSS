                <p class="main-text"><i>BOULDER DASH II.: </i><strong>Boulder Dash</strong> is a
                    popular strategy/maze game originally created by
                    Peter Liepa and
                    Chris Gray for Atari 8-bit and released by First Star Software in 1984.<br><br>

                    The game was ported to several platforms including Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 2600,
                    BBC
                    Micro, ColecoVision, Intellivision, MSX, NES, ZX Spectrum and many others. <strong>Boulder
                        Dash</strong> was so
                    successful to be ported also on arcade. An arcade game was infact released in 1985. It's one of the
                    few
                    cases where a home computer game is ported to arcade, usually it's the contrary.<br><br>

                    You are Rockford and you have to dig through the caves searching for diamonds and avoiding monsters.

                    <strong>Boulder Dash</strong> received very positive reviews and it's considered one of the best
                    games ever released

                <p class="main-text"><i>THE LAST NINJA 3: </i>The third in the <strong>Last Ninja</strong> series sees
                    you as Armakuni, the Last
                    Ninja. He is
                    drawn
                    again into a battle with evil Shogun Kunitoki. The battle will take place among the temples of
                    Tibet,
                    the source of the Last Ninja's mystical strength. The Shogun intends to corrupt these Buddhist
                    temples,
                    to destroy the source of power for Armakuni and his emerging Ninja brotherhood. Armakuni must stop
                    the
                    Shogun's evil scheme.<br><br>

                    The game retains the mix of martial arts combat (hand-to-hand and with various weapons), puzzles
                    involving various objects you find on your way, and navigating your way around obstacles. However,
                    it
                    also introduces Bushido, necessary to complete each level. Bushido is earned by fighting honorably,
                    by
                    fighting enemies with the same weapon as them or in hand-to-hand combat, and not fleeing from a
                    battle.<br><br>

                    The levels correspond to the elements that combine to make up a Ninja's power, Earth, Water, Wind,
                    Fire
                    and Void.
